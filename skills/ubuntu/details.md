I discovered Ubuntu in the end of 2004. I immediatly tried it on my PowerPC machines and found it very interesting, but it lacked KDE support, which was my Desktop Environment of choice.

In 2005, as I was planning to create an Education company, I gave it another try when Edubuntu came out, and was amazed by the support it had for all my peripherals out of the box.

Ubuntu has been my OS for choice for Desktops ever since, and I've also used it for production purpose on many occasions.

In the end of 2005, I started contributing to Ubuntu as a packager, and quickly gained upload privileges to the whole repository. My main tasks at the time were to maintain KDE packages and review new packages for the universe repository.

I stopped using KDE a few years later, but I still keep my upload rights to maintain the augeas packages in Ubuntu.
