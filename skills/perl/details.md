As a junior sysadmin, Perl came to me as a powerful language to replace bash scripts that were too limited.

I started by contributing to existing Perl scripts at Orange Portails, and quickly started to write my own software, including a general testing framework for our infrastructure (TreeTester) and a CVS server replication tool (CVSSync), both of which were never open-sourced.

Even though I don't use Perl as much anymore, I still maintain a few packages [on the CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~raphink/).
