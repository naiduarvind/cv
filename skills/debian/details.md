In 2001, Debian was the first GNU/Linux OS I installed at home. At the time, I quickly switched to YellowDog (a RedHat fork for PowerPC machines) and later Mandrake as it was easier for me to learn.

I came back to Debian in 2005. I started a project of distribution based on Knoppix, and switched to Ubuntu in October 2005.

To this day, Debian remains my OS of choice for production servers.
