My first contributions to Puppet in 2007 introduced me to Ruby. Since I started using Puppet extensively in 2012, Ruby has become my main programming language.

In spite of its speed downfalls, I appreciate the language's extreme flexibility.

#### Projects

* [AugeasProviders](https://augeasproviders.com), alternative Augeas-based providers for Puppet
* Various Puppet modules, including many Ruby plugins for Puppet
