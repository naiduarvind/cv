In 2000, RedHat was the first GNU/Linux OS I was exposed to, at the University. I used YellowDog (a version for PowerPC machines) for a while, and then moved to Mandrake for a few years.

While I never came back to RedHat systems for home needs, I have had the occasion to configure and maintain many RedHat-based systems over the years.
