\tlcventry{2020}{0}{Head of Engineering \& Acting Operations Lead}{\href{https://mindvalley.com}{Mindvalley}}{}{}%
  {
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Collaborated with the Chief Product Officer in migrating the entire engineering division off Wrike to Jira adopting Kanban Flow for brownfield projects and Scrum for greenfield projects quickly proving to be a success in delivering measureable outcomes;
      \item Worked with the Product Marketing department to develop a streamlined process with the help of Operations and Acquisition team for going live with new launches reducing Mean Time to Live from 1 month to 1 day which was a huge success accredited by the Chief Executive Officer;
      \item Conducted a bi-weekly session to foster a highly collaborative culture with the Tech Leads to adopt measurable CI/CD going from 0 to 37 pipelines within 3 months along with newer concepts of observable GitOps to ensure visibility of delivery excellence -- observable value stream;
      \item Automated visibility of cost for the organisation by taking the ITSM approach and the guidance of ITIL practices working with the Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Operating Officer which automatically tracks CAPEX and OPEX with accountability attached using Quickbooks, Jira and Data Studio;
      \item Fostered the adoption of standardized C4Model for the entire engineering department backed by a dynamically updated graph database by listening to changes done in Github for ISO 27001 which also proved to reduce Mean Time to Detection for engineers to troubleshoot a change;
      \item Led the effort with the Chief Technology Officer and Chief Product Offier to develop engineering-wide good practices, lean standardized specification guidelines, and (inter and intra)-departmental communications significantly reducing back and forth clarifications driving deliverables quicker.
    \end{itemize}
}

\tlcventry{2019}{2020}{Engineering Manager \& Acting Operations Lead}{\href{https://mindvalley.com}{Mindvalley}}{}{}%
  {
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Established a cross-functional Operations team made up of IT, Infrastructure, Security, and QA with the help of the Chief Technology Officer which quickly proved to be successful in reducing development time, release corrections, customer feature implementations and support requests (internal / external);
      \item Overhauled the hiring pipeline for the engineering division with the help of the People \& Culture team and Tech Leads with instrumentation that surfaced cost per hire in Greenhouse which helped remove the bottleneck of culture fit interviews quickly helping the Mobile team to backfill -- a problem for over a year and later proving to be successful with insourcing an application;
      \item Automatically vizualised the operating costs for the entire engineering division collaborating with the Chief Technology Officer by setting up proper querying mechanism using Honeycomb with proper alert thresholds set for each team associated to yearly budget which also successfully surfaced cost per customer for the entire organisation later;
      \item Spearheaded the IPO initiative for the organisation working with an InfoSec Manager by documenting the current processes from all departments and streamlining the processes adopting an automation first mindset with the help of the Operations team being apart of the governance board -- later establishing a lean Change Approval Board (CAB).
    \end{itemize}

\tlcventry{2016}{2019}{Site Reliability Engineer}{\href{https://servicerocket.com}{ServiceRocket}}{}{\href{https://learndot.com}{Learndot}}%
  {
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Spearheaded an R\&D initiative of a new scalable platform to completion and developed the migration pipeline of customers residing in the legacy private cloud providing a reliable / stable infrastructure;
      \item Devised visibility of costing on each service to the stakeholders that allowed insights to tooling usages ultimately developing mechanisms to eliminate waste across engineering by \$20k/year;
      \item Cultivated ownership among engineers by simplifying observability using a one view, one truth principle on reliability regressions and security vulnerabilities by adopting tools with buy-in;
      \item Embraced appropriately observable systems adopting the OpenTracing standard for instrumentation in the business unit with members of the SRE team and cross-polinated the mindset to the development team;
      \item Re-established trust between engineering and support teams by creating consistent outcomes and stabilizing the platform, bringing bugs identified per week down by 90 percent.
    \end{itemize}

  {
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Built CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins and Jira to fire-and forget automated deployments for customers with different artifact versions and ensuring version consistency between environments;
      \item Centralized logging from over 40 customers to enhance engineers and support engineers experience in troubleshooting thus reducing intervention to customer instances adhering to compliance;
      \item Handled complex escalations involving some of the largest customers by adopting short-term fix and long-term prevention mindset;
