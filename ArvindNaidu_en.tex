\tlcventry{2020}{0}{Head of Engineering \& Acting Operations Lead}{\href{https://mindvalley.com}{Mindvalley}}{}{}%
  {
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Collaborated with the CPO to migrate engineering from Wrike to Jira adopting Kanban Flow  and Scrum for brownfield and greenfield projects respectively quickly delivering measureable outcomes;
      \item Worked with Product Marketing to develop a streamlined new product launch process with the help of Operations and Acquisition team reducing MTTL from 1 month to 1 day -- accredited by the CEO;
      \item Conducted sessions to foster a highly collaborative culture with the TLMs adopting measurable CI/CD (GitOps) from 0 to 37 pipelines within 3 months bringing observability towards value stream;
      \item Automated visibility of organisational costs adhering to ITSM and ITIL practices working with the CRO and COO that automatically tracks CAPEX and OPEX using Quickbooks, Jira and Data Studio;
      \item Fostered the adoption of C4 Model for engineering backed by a continuously updated graph database listening to changes done on Github for ISO 27001 -- reducing MTTR in troubleshooting changes;
      \item Led an effort with the CTO and CPO to develop good engineering practices, lean standardized guidelines, and (inter and intra)-departmental communications -- reducing clarifications driving deliverables quicker.
    \end{itemize}
}

\tlcventry{2019}{2020}{Engineering Manager \& Acting Operations Lead}{\href{https://mindvalley.com}{Mindvalley}}{}{}%
  {
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Established a cross-functional Operations team made up of IT, Infrastructure, Security, and QA which proved successful in reducing development time, release corrections, customer feature implementations and support requests (internal / external);
      \item Overhauled hiring for engineering collaborating with People team and TLMs instrumentating cost per hire in Greenhouse that helped remove culture fit interview bottleneck for backfilling the Mobile team -- problem for a year and proving success again insourcing an application;
      \item Automatically vizualised OPEX for engineering collaborating using a querying mechanism, Honeycomb with alert thresholds for each team associated to yearly budgets that subsequently surfaced cost per customer for the entire organisation;
      \item Spearheaded ISO 270001 for IPO by dynamically documenting and streamlining processes from all departments adopting an automation first mindset with the help of Operations later establishing a lean Change Approval Board (CAB).
    \end{itemize}
}

\tlcventry{2016}{2019}{Site Reliability Engineer}{\href{https://servicerocket.com}{ServiceRocket}}{}{\href{https://learndot.com}{Learndot}}%
  {
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Spearheaded an R\&D initiative of a new scalable platform to completion and developed the migration pipeline of customers residing in legacy private cloud providing a reliable platform;
      \item Devised visibility of costing on each service to the stakeholders that allowed insights to tooling usages ultimately developing mechanisms to eliminate waste across engineering by \$20k/year;
      \item Cultivated ownership among engineers by simplifying observability using a one view, one truth principle on reliability regressions and security vulnerabilities by adopting tools with buy-in;
      \item Embraced appropriately observable systems adopting the OpenTracing standard for instrumentation with members of the SRE team then cross-polinating to the development team;
      \item Re-established trust between engineering and support teams by achieving consistent outcomes stabilizing the platform bringing customer pain points down by 90 percent.
    \end{itemize}
}

\tlcventry{2016}{2017}{Systems Operations Engineer}{\href{https://servicerocket.com}{ServiceRocket}}{}{\href{https://learndot.com}{Learndot}}%
  {
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Built CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins and Jira to fire-and forget automated deployments for customers with different artifact versions and ensuring version consistency between environments;
      \item Centralized observability for over 40 customers to enhance engineers and support engineers experience in troubleshooting thus reducing intervention to  instances for compliance;
      \item Handled complex escalations involving some of the largest customers by adopting short-term fix and long-term prevention mindset;
    \end{itemize}
